### This repository is private, only sharing with students doing BMEN 4460 course final project in Spring 2023 at Columbia.
## Project name: Schizophrenia MRI Classification Using Deep Learning

All required source codes and commands are saved in this repositor, including:

**main_10fold.py**

**data_loader_10fold.py**

**GlobalLocalTransformer3D_multiscale.py**

**vgg3D_for_transformer.py**

**vgg.py**

**command.sh** (command instruction file, not code)

If you are familiar with deep learning pipelines and have Python coding experience, you should have no trouble understanding the codes on your own. If you do need help implementing them, please see the instructions for each file below:


### Before we start: ###

All the codes are saved in .py format. If you are using online coding enviroment such as Colab and Kaggle, you probably run into the jupyter notebooks ending with .ipynb. To run the .py files on Colab, please see this [quick tutorial(https://rafat-joy99.medium.com/how-to-run-py-files-on-google-colab-46af2831e166) and more helpful instructions online.

### main_10fold.py ###
The only .py file you need to run using the command in command.sh
